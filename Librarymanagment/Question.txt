Design a library system with two classes: Book and Library. Use ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap to manage books and author information.

Classes and Methods:
1. Book
Attributes:

bookId (int): Unique ID for the book.
title (String): Title of the book.
author (String): Author of the book.
Methods:

Constructor to initialize bookId, title, and author.
toString() to return a string representation of the book.
2. Library
Attributes:

books (ArrayList): To store the list of books.
uniqueBooks (HashSet): To avoid duplicate books by tracking book IDs.
authorCount (HashMap): To store the count of books by each author.
Methods:

addBook(Book book): Adds a book to the library if itâ€™s not a duplicate.
removeBook(int bookId): Removes a book by its ID.
displayBooks(): Displays all books in the library.
displayAuthorCount(): Displays the count of books by each author.

Sample Input and Output:

Input:

Library library = new Library();

// Add books
library.addBook(new Book(1, "Java Basics", "John Doe"));
library.addBook(new Book(2, "Advanced Java", "John Doe"));
library.addBook(new Book(3, "Data Structures", "Jane Smith"));
library.addBook(new Book(1, "Java Basics", "John Doe")); // Duplicate

// Remove a book
library.removeBook(2);

// Display books and author count
library.displayBooks();
library.displayAuthorCount();

Output:

Book added: Java Basics
Book added: Advanced Java
Book added: Data Structures
Duplicate book not added: Java Basics
	: Advanced Java

Books in Library:
Book ID: 1, Title: Java Basics, Author: John Doe
Book ID: 3, Title: Data Structures, Author: Jane Smith

Author Count:
John Doe: 1
Jane Smith: 1
